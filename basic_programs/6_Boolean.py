# Explain below
print("------Bool values --------")

y = 99

a = 0
print(bool(x))
print(bool(y))

# in py bool() function evaluates the value based on its truthness
# in the above case its a non empty value thus its consider as True
print(bool(z))
print(bool(a))
# in the above case z is an empty variable tha has null value hence its False
# Almost all values are true except the empty ones
# All string are true except empty ones
# all numbers are true except 0 ones
# All list tuple set and dictionary are true except empty ones
